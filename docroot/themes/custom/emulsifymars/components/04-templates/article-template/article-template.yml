section_subheader2: 'EMPOWERING WOMEN TODAY'
article_text: >
  Each year we spend the month of March celebrating Women's History Month and International Women's Day.
  We pay tribute to incredible women who worked to  drive progress and hope to inspire future leaders that will continue to push for change and never settle for the status quo.
  This year I had the privilege of celebrating International Women's Day in Gueyo, Cote d'Ivoire with over 1,000 women who are making history every day.
  It was a celebration of the women themselves, and all they have and will accomplished through their work in connection with the Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) program.
  To have the opportunity to meet these incredible women, celebrate their successes, meet their families, hear their inspiring stories, was inspiring, humbling and filled me with a tremendous amount pride.
